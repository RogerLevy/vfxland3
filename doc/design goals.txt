- Not worrying about 64-bit, or porting to other systems
- Modules will be as decoupled as possible
    - Non-awareness of "class" definition
    - Non-awareness of instantiation where possible
    - Dependencies are managed by loading modules
- As few core extensions as possible.  Where they're required, keep local.
- As little dynamic instantiation as possible.
- A focus on workflow, tools (special tailoring for a specific game)
- Work on serialization, use game functionality to create tools
- Ultimately, standalone tools, standardization of data formats, an IDE (OS-like)
    - Tools and tool-making bits that can take advantage of the subsystem
- Simplicity over performance, deferring optimization
- Make a game in a branch and then standardize stuff
